## Hardware and software

The board I've elected to use is a [Fly Puppet 5](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004491731502.html) - which once I get hold of a CM4 should have a nice small footprint.

Using a [Mellow Fly sht36 v2](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004687165673.html) canbus toolhead board with a fly utoc.
